let numbers = [ 20, 9, 3, 41, 8, 1, 56 ];

// STEP 1: Sort the "numbers" array from smallest number to largest
//         number and ensure the "numbers" array is sorted afterwards
//         in the console



// STEP 2: Write an algorithm that searches through the sorted array
//         for a supplied number, as if it was a word in a dictionary.



// STEP 3: Ensure the algorithm gives expected results for numbers
//         that are in the array and numbers that are not in the array
//
//         Example: 100 should NOT be found, but 41 should be found.
