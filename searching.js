let numbers = [ 20, 9, 3, 41, 8, 1, 56 ];

// STEP 1: Sort the "numbers" array from smallest number to largest
//         number and ensure the "numbers" array is sorted afterwards
//         in the console



// STEP 2: Write an algorithm that searches through the sorted array
//         for a supplied number, as if it were a word in a dictionary.
//
//         Example: Check the value in the center of the unchecked
//                  values. If it is the value you're looking for,
//                  return that value. If it is greater than the value
//                  you're looking for, forget the current value and
//                  all values greater than the current value, use the
//                  remaining set of unchecked values, and start over.
//                  If there are no values remaining in the set of
//                  unchecked values, consider the value you're
//                  searching for to be not in the array.



// STEP 3: Ensure the algorithm gives expected results for numbers
//         that are in the array and numbers that are not in the array.
//
//         Example: 100 and 0 should NOT be found, but 41 and any
//                  number in the "numbers" array should be found.
