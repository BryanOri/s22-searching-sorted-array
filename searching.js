let numbers = [ 3, 1, 9, 20, 41, 8, 56, 17, 2, 13, 26, 30, 4, 49 ];

// STEP 1: Sort the "numbers" array from smallest number to largest
//         number and ensure the "numbers" array is sorted afterwards
//         in the console



// STEP 2: Write an algorithm that searches through the sorted array
//         for a supplied number, as if it was a word in a dictionary.



// STEP 3: Ensure the algorithm gives expected results for both for
//         numbers that are in the array and numbers that are not in
//         the array
//
//         Example: 100 should not be found, but 49 should be found.
